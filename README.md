## 🔍 Key Insights
- Sales show a **clear downward trend**, as identified from Prophet’s trend component.
- Monthly revenue gradually decreases from early 2019 toward later months.
- Forecast results indicate that **future sales are expected to continue declining**, with uncertainty widening over time.
- Actual historical sales points fall within the forecast confidence interval, showing that the model captures the overall pattern well.
- No strong seasonal spikes are visible in this dataset due to the limited time range.
